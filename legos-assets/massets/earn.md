# EARN

EARN is the place where a portion of Legos.finance Public `LEGO` are currently distributed. The other place is the "Deposit Box" in SAVE. It is primarily built as a way to distribute Meta tokens and decentralise the governance community of the Legos.finance protocol, while at the same time contributing to the utility of the protocol.

### **Earning LEGO**

To earn `LEGO` rewards, users must contribute liquidity pool tokens from the relevant pool to the mStable EARN contracts.

### Impermanent Loss

Finally, it is important to state that participation in these liquidity pools can expose you to _impermanent loss_. In particular, pools containing volatile tokens as one or both sides of the pool are very susceptible to impermanent loss as the price of the volatile token changes. Please do your own due diligence on impermanent loss before choosing to use EARN.
