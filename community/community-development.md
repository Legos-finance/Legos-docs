If you love the product and want to see Legos.finance grow to a billion-dollar DeFi protocol, there are many ways that you can contribute. Read on to find out how!

## Metanauts Assemble!

There are many ways of contributing as a Metanaut, depending on your interests.

### Community Growth

We are on the lookout for contributors who can write and design content, produce visuals, videos, educational materials, GIFs and sticker packs, or onboard new users into our community.

### Community Management

You can also contribute by helping us manage the community across keeping content updated, taking notes during governance calls, translation efforts and Discord/Forum housekeeping.
